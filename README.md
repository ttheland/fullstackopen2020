React, Redux, Node.js, MongoDB, GraphQL, TypeScript



Part 4 covered the creation of a [node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) backend structure for a blog list application using async/await,
following [RESTful](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3/node_js_and_express#rest) conventions in the HTTP API.


Testing it using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) and [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest).


Handling errors with [express-async-errors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-async-errors) and custom middleware.


Implementing user administration on the backend, including token-based authorization using [jwt](https://jwt.io/) and [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt).

Part 5 continued the development of the example note app, covering the handling of token-based user logins in the frontend, the use of React's PropTypes, props.children, and refs.

End to end-testing using [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/), a powerful e2e-testing library for JavaScript.

Applying learned concepts to the blog list app.

The 6th part delved into using React-Redux for component state management, development with redux devtools, using async actions to communicate with backend with redux-thunk, and offered a look into the legacy connect API to manage react component states in a redux store.
