This part covered the creation of a backend structure for a blog list application using async/await,
following [RESTful](https://fullstackopen.com/en/part3/node_js_and_express#rest) conventions in the HTTP API.


Testing it using [Jest](https://jestjs.io/en/) and [supertest](https://www.npmjs.com/package/supertest).


Handling errors with [express-async-errors](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express-async-errors) and custom middleware.


Implementing user administration on the backend, including token-based authorization using [jwt](https://jwt.io/) and [bcrypt](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bcrypt).
